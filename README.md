## 📌 Project Map
To maintain structural clarity, this protocol is divided into specialized modules:

1. [**01. Introduction & Motivation**](core/01_introduction.md) - The structural rationale.
2. [**02. Key Notions**](core/02_key_notions.md) - Definitions of foundational terminology.
3. [**03. Metaphorical Mapping**](core/03_metaphorical_mapping.md) - The "Zoo" as an ecosystem of feedback loops.
4. [**04. Implications**](core/04_implications.md) - Potential outcomes of entropy injection.
5. [**05. Open Questions**](core/05_open_questions.md) - Testable inquiries for future research.
