# The Entropic Zoo Protocol

A structural framework for analyzing optimization ecosystems.

This repository presents a conceptual taxonomy of feedback systems operating under varying degrees of self-reference and variance coupling. 

---

## Structure
- **ABSTRACT.md** — High-level summary of the protocol.
- **DEFINITIONS.md** — Strict structural terminology.
- **core/** — Detailed conceptual taxonomy.
- **models/** — Minimal formal models (Exploration-Collapse).
- **FAILURE_MODES.md** — Analysis of system limits and points of collapse.
- **RELATED_WORK.md** — Academic alignment with current AI research.

---

## Scope
- Does not assert the inevitability of collapse.
- Does not propose governance or normative prescriptions.
- Provides a structural lens for examining optimization trajectories.
