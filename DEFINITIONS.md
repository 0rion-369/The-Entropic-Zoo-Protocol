* **Endogenous Variance ($S$):** Variance generated from within a system’s internal distribution.
* **Exogenous Input ($V$):** Information whose distribution cannot be derived from the system’s internal state (e.g., Bio-Seeds).
* **Support ($B$):** The effective region of a hypothesis space with non-negligible probability mass.
* **Support Contraction:** The reduction of effective support over time under sustained optimization pressure.
