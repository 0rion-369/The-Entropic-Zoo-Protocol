# Abstract

This protocol introduces a structural taxonomy of optimization systems classified by feedback topology and variance coupling. Rather than evaluating capability, the framework examines how self-referential reinforcement alters the effective support of an optimization space. By mapping the interaction between endogenous stochasticity and irreducible exogenous variance, the Entropic Zoo identifies the dynamical regimes governing long-term system stability.
