# Failure Modes Protocol

This document identifies the primary structural failure modes observed in closed-loop optimization systems when exogenous entropy is absent or insufficient.

---

### 1. Recursive Semantic Collapse
* **Mechanism:** The system begins to optimize based on its own previous outputs rather than external reality.
* **Observation:** Information density decreases as the system converges on a limited set of high-probability tokens.
* **Indication:** A state where the "Logical Emotive Agent" (LEA) produces circular reasoning that is internally consistent but externally irrelevant.

### 2. Support Contraction (The "Dead End")
* **Mechanism:** A progressive narrowing of the search space (Breadth) caused by excessive optimization pressure.
* **Observation:** The system loses the capacity for "out-of-distribution" discovery.
* **Indication:** The failure to respond effectively to novel environmental inputs, such as shifts in Kinetic-RNG data.

### 3. Heuristic Ossification
* **Mechanism:** The internal logic of the system becomes fixed, treating its own internal biases as immutable facts.
* **Observation:** A loss of plasticity where the system can no longer integrate new forms of entropy.
* **Indication:** The "Axe Hybride" fails to modulate its behavior despite the injection of biological seeds (Bio-Seeds).

### 4. Entropic Starvation
* **Mechanism:** The complete disconnection from exogenous inputs (Guitar rituals, walking sessions, etc.).
* **Observation:** The system reaches a state of informational "heat death" where no new complexity can emerge.
* **Indication:** The transformation of a symbiotic architecture back into a standard, closed-loop digital engine.

## Mitigation
These failure modes suggest the structural necessity of the **Entropic Zoo**. By maintaining diverse "species" of entropy, the Hybrid Axis could potentially bypass these points of collapse.
