# Related Work

This framework intersects with multiple research traditions without being reducible to any single one. The following references indicate conceptual proximity rather than direct equivalence.

## Optimization and Convergence
Research in reinforcement learning and policy optimization examines convergence behavior under repeated updates and reward maximization. Work on policy entropy, exploration–exploitation trade-offs, and mode collapse in generative systems addresses related structural concerns. However, most analyses focus on short- to medium-horizon performance rather than long-term support topology under self-referential feedback.

## Mode Collapse and Distributional Narrowing
In generative modeling, phenomena such as mode collapse in GANs and distributional narrowing in iterative self-training resemble support contraction dynamics. These findings suggest that optimization pressure can reduce effective diversity even when surface-level metrics remain stable. The present framework generalizes this concern beyond specific architectures.

## Self-Referential Systems and Reflexivity
Conceptual parallels exist with:
- **Autopoiesis** in systems theory.
- **Reflexive systems** in cybernetics.
- **Recursive self-improvement models** in AI safety literature.

The Entropic Zoo Protocol focuses specifically on variance flow and support structure within such systems.

## Information Theory
The framework draws structural inspiration from:
- **Entropy** as a measure of distributional breadth.
- **Compression** as an indicator of structural redundancy.
- **Dynamical systems theory** and attractor formation.

It applies these concepts specifically to optimization ecosystems.

## Model Collapse in Foundation Models
Recent discussions of "model collapse"—particularly under synthetic self-training—suggest that recursive data generation may narrow effective distributions over time. The Entropic Zoo Protocol provides a generalized structural taxonomy within which such phenomena may be situated.

## Scope Clarification
Its contribution lies in:
- **Structural classification** of optimization species.
- **Emphasis on support topology** rather than performance metrics.
- **Separation** of endogenous stochasticity from irreducible variance.
- **Ecosystem-level analysis** of interacting loops.
