## Optimization and Convergence

Literature on reinforcement learning and iterative policy optimization examines system behavior under repeated updates and selection pressure. These analyses often focus on performance or regret minimization over finite horizons rather than long-term structural support topology.

## Distributional Narrowing and Mode Collapse

Phenomena termed “mode collapse” in generative modeling and distributional narrowing in self-training protocols describe how optimization can reduce effective diversity within a distribution. These observations highlight structural concerns that are analogous to support contraction but within specific model classes.

## Recursive and Reflexive Systems

Related conceptual frameworks exist in:
- Cybernetics (recursive feedback systems)
- Systems theory (autopoietic systems)
- Self-improvement models in AI safety discussions

These traditions examine the interplay of system outputs and future inputs in long-term dynamics.

## Information Theoretic Constructs

This framework uses structural quantities such as entropy, compressibility, and support breadth as analytical lenses. While not contributing new information-theoretic results, it situates these constructs within ecosystem dynamics of interacting loops.

## Exploration–Exploitation and Long-Horizon Behavior

Work in decision processes and reinforcement learning explores the tension between exploration and exploitation. The present framework generalizes these insights toward structural support over extended trajectories.

## Scope Clarification

This document does not:
- Claim novelty for each conceptual element
- Propose new algorithms or measurable proofs
- Provide a comprehensive literature mapping

It situates the present framework in relation to extant conceptual work in optimization dynamics, recursive systems, and information structure.
