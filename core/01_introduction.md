# 01. Introduction and Motivation

This document establishes a conceptual framework for examining the role of informational entropy within optimization systems. As modern architectures trend toward increased self-referential feedback, a structural question emerges regarding the preservation of exploratory breadth.

### Objective
The aim is not to assert a systemic crisis or to prescribe definitive governance models. Instead, this protocol maps the interactions between exogenous chaos and endogenous logic to identify the conditions necessary for sustained evolution.

### Context
The "Entropic Zoo" serves as a philosophical companion to empirical research. While it defines the boundaries and metaphors of the problem, the rigorous testing of optimization risks is handled through separate, data-driven protocols.
