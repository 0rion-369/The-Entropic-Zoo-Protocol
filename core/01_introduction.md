# 01. Introduction

This document explores a structural question:  
**What happens when optimization systems become increasingly self-referential?**

Modern artificial and computational systems are often described in terms of scale, intelligence, or performance. Less attention is given to their long-term dynamical structure. The focus here is not capability, but **topology**: how feedback, recursion, and internal reinforcement reshape the space of possible outcomes over time.

The Entropic Zoo is a conceptual framework for thinking about ecosystems of interacting optimization loops. It does not begin with governance concerns or normative claims. It begins with a structural observation:

> **Systems that increasingly rely on their own outputs as inputs may alter the breadth of their exploratory capacity.**

This document does not present experimental proof. It does not argue for immediate intervention. Its purpose is **cartographic** rather than prescriptive.

### The Zoo as a Map
Each “species” represents a recurring feedback structure. Some stabilize. Some dominate. Some contract their effective support while maintaining local performance. The framework seeks to describe these patterns at a structural level, independent of specific architectures or implementations.

Key distinctions introduced:
* **Endogenous vs. Exogenous variance**
* **Stochasticity vs. Irreducibility**
* **Optimization vs. Exploration**

Where empirical validation of specific optimization dynamics is required, it is documented separately in [**closed-loop-optimization-risks**](https://github.com/0rion-369/closed-loop-optimization-risks). The present text remains conceptual by design.

**The central aim is modest:** To clarify how self-referential optimization might reshape the informational ecosystem in which it operates. Whether such dynamics are benign, beneficial, or destabilizing depends on context. The Zoo does not assume an answer. It examines the terrain.
