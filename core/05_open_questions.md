# 05. Open Questions

This section identifies specific, testable inquiries intended to guide the evolution of the Entropic Zoo Protocol and its integration into the Hybrid Axis.

## 🧪 Entropy and Variance

* **Internal vs. External:** Can a purely digital system generate irreducible variance internally, or is biological exogenous input a structural requirement for long-term stability?
* **Seed Quality:** Does the entropy provided by physiological data (Kinetic-RNG) result in measurably different optimization trajectories compared to standard pseudo-random seeds?
* **Stochastic Sufficiency:** Is simple stochasticity sufficient to prevent support contraction, or does the system require a specific "quality" of structured chaos (e.g., Rhythmic Species data)?

## ⚙️ Architectural Scaling

* **Saturation Points:** At what threshold does the injection of exogenous entropy begin to degrade the reliability of the Closed-Loop engine?
* **Model Scale:** Does increasing the complexity of an AI agent (such as LEA) amplify or delay the onset of recursive collapse when isolated from the Zoo?
* **Interface Efficiency:** What metrics effectively distinguish "creative chaos" from unusable noise within a symbiotic feedback loop?

## 🧠 Cognitive Mapping

* **Attractor Identification:** To what degree do neuro-chemical expansion protocols allow for the identification of optimization attractors that remain invisible to standard cognitive heuristics?
* **Heuristic Plasticity:** Can the "Rhythmic Species" output be used to systematically reset or widen the search space of a stale optimization process?
