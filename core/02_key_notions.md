# 02. Key Notions

This section defines the foundational terminology required to analyze the interaction between chaos and order within the Hybrid Axis.

### Exogenous Entropy
* **Definition:** Information introduced from an external source whose distribution is not derived from the system's internal state.
* **Intuition:** The "raw material" of surprise; representing everything the system does not yet "contain".
* **Not to be confused with:** Stochastic noise or simple processing errors.

### Endogenous Optimization
* **Definition:** The process of refining internal parameters based solely on existing data models and self-referential feedback.
* **Intuition:** The system becoming increasingly efficient at executing established patterns.
* **Not to be confused with:** Genuine learning or adaptation to novel environments.

### Support Contraction
* **Definition:** A phenomenon where the range of possible outputs from an AI system narrows over time due to recursive feedback loops.
* **Intuition:** The "walls" of the system closing in as it loses touch with external reality.
* **Not to be confused with:** Intentional specialization.

### The Hybrid Axis (L'AXE HYBRIDE)
* **Definition:** A symbiotic architecture designed to balance the reliability of closed-loop systems with the creative vitality of entropic inputs.
* **Intuition:** A bridge that prevents system collapse by systematically injecting human chaos into logical structures.
